# Habitat-Protection-Analysis
This project consists of two terms.
In the first term, I separated preserve data first by their build/promote time range, and then by their range. 
I separated animal data by each animal's habitat range. 
I then intersect the output of animal data and the output of preserve data.

In the second term, I only separated preserve data by their build/promote time. and intersect them with animal data.
