# Habitat-Protection-Analysis
## Project 1
1. Select animal records based on the habitat size of each species ([code 1](https://github.com/yilunz/Habitat-Protection-Analysis/blob/master/animal_code_use.py))
2. Select preserve records based on the build/promote time, then by preserve size ([code 2](https://github.com/yilunz/Habitat-Protection-Analysis/blob/master/preserve_code.py))
4. Intersect 1 and 2, output as CSV files (code 3)

## Project 2
